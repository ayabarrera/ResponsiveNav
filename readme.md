Design Choices
- Since I've decided to work on  my portfolio, I wanted to include images of my previous works. I've decided to make my website as simple as I can.
- I wanted to use tailwind, but I was having a hard time implementing it - so I just used CSS also as a means to practice more on this aspect.
- I wanted to focus on visual hierarchy, making my works clear, prominent, and easy to access.
- I also didn't use a lot of colours especially for the background since there are already a lot of elements in the pages. So it remains easier on the eyes of the viewers.
- On the About page, I tried to implement key frames to the heading as I feel like it reflects who I am as a person - bubbly and colorful. I wanted to make my website leaning on black / darker colours but I feel like it doesn't suit who I am. 


Dry Code
- For the dry coding, I tried to use the same css porperties for elements that are grouped the same.
- There are still a lot of aspects I have to clean up, but I'm really happy with the outcome of this project.
    - These are all for future improvements for my portfolio website. 


I was looking at different portfolios that I've liked and I compiled all the elements that I wanted to see in my website and of course in line with my current skill level!
